## Week 6

### Module 1

#### 1.1

* How to assess an event study (with a market simulator)
* Event study allows you to test hypotheses:
  * What if Market Bollinger value is high
    * Look at equity and market to see if any discrepencies.
  * But stock Bollinger value is low?
  * Buy signal?
* Simulator lets you operationalize
  * Transition from hypothesis to strategy
    * Buy/sell
    * How long to hold?
    * How much to allocate to each bet?

### Module 2

#### 2.1

* Fundamental law of active portfolio management.
* Warren Buffett quote: "Wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing."
* Thought experiment:
  * Stock trade = bet
  * Coin flip = bet
  * Uncertainty = beta
  * Coin bias = Alpha
    * 51% heads
* Reward/Risk measures:
  * Possibility to lose everything
  * Standard deviations of returns
* Alpha is lower you should can make more bets?
* --Opinion-- didn't really follow this lesson all that well.

#### 2.2

* Active portfolio "investors" are not considered investors in Warren Buffett's eyes.
* Jim Simons and Warren Buffet offer about the same performance
* Buffet -- 54% in just 3 stocks (2010)
* Simon trades actively -- 100ks per day
* Algorithmic trades can "scale"
* The two can be related with "the fundamental law"

### Module 3

#### 3.1

* Covers CAPM.
* Understanding beta and alpha of a portfolio
* Didn't follow this so well. Really not interested.

#### 3.2

* Active Portfolio Management recommended again
* More on using CAPM to build a portfolio (shorting companies, "longing" companies)
* Hedge fund stuff. Not particularly interesting to me at this stage.
